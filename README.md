# QTG_Finder

QTG-Finder is a novel machine-learning pipeline to prioritize causal genes for QTLs identified by linkage mapping. We trained QTG-Finder models for Arabidopsis and rice based on the known causal genes from each species, respectively. By utilizing additional information like poly-morphisms, function annotation, co-function network, and paralog copy number, the models can rank QTL genes to prioritize causal genes.
